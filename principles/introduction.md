# SOLID

## What is solid

SOLID is an acronym published by Robert C. Martin and consists of five principles tackling different problems in software development. All five principles can be unstood as subjective guidelines for coding in object oriented and functional programming.
Some programmers like me are riding the cult train because of many upsides. But even if it is cult, it is damn simple to programm SOLID.

## Why should we use it

SOLID leads to smaller pieces of code and enhances expectations regarding inheritance and api design. These enhancements lead to the following advantages:

- Better readability
- Enhanced fulfilment of expectations
- Less merge conflicts in bigger teams
- Increased ability to reuse code
- More specific designations
- Increased maintainability
- Enhanced flexibility
- Unit-testability
